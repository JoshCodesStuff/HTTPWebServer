# webserver
A http web server built in C as Uni project. This project may not run on a Windows system as it was built using Linux. It has been tested on WSL.

# How to Use:
A quick How-To, getting started with running and using this webserver.

## Compiling:
Compile the code with `make` and start the code either `./webserver [PORT]` where port is a modified port number, or `run.sh` will run the webserver on `PORT=8080`.

## Usage:
After running the webserver, head to http://localhost:8080 to see the documents contained in `/public`. You should see the following text:

## Congratulations, your Web server is working!

If you do not see the text then there is a good chance that one of the previous steps has failed somehow.
